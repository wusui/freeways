Steam game Freeways designed by Justin Smith.

## Insane Manifesto Style Rant

Freeways is a very good game with one serious flaw -- the user interface is unforgiving.  There
is no way to take back a mistake other than to clear the whole screen and start over.  I have
fat fingers and my motor skills leave a lot to be desired, and I never got higher than a D+ in
penmanship so you can imagine how well I handle a mouse.  Since I am somewhat sapient and
therefore a toolmaker, I have started to try to handle this by designing a tool to do the
drudgery of mousing and clicking for me.

Note that ideally I will have an application where one can describe what one wants to do
and the actions get automatically performed by the program.  This to me, feels like a good
solution and does not intefere with what I believe to be the core feature of the game -- solving
the puzzle of connecting the roads efficiently.  The user still has to design a map to optimize
scores.  The fun stuff is still there in all its glory.  The icky stuff isn't.
